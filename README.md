- 👋 Hi, I’m @baoquoc210  
  Hey there! I’m @baoquoc210, an aspiring AI Engineer and Data Analyst with a deep passion for crafting Generative AI solutions and turning data into impactful innovations.

- 👀 I’m interested in:  
  - **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript  
  - **Generative AI Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Stable Diffusion, GANs (via Keras/TensorFlow), VAE (Variational Autoencoders)  
  - **AI/ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, OpenAI API, LangChain  
  - **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS  
  - **Backend Development:** Node.js (Fastify, Nest.js), Java (Javalin, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf)  
  - **Databases:** SQL, MongoDB  
  - **Cloud Platforms:** AWS  
  - **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau  
  I’m obsessed with building creative AI systems—like text generators, image synthesizers, and beyond—while blending them with sleek web applications.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
  Full-stack development with ReactJS and Node.js to deploy Generative AI models as interactive web tools, powered by frameworks like Nest.js and Spring Boot.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  
  Projects involving Generative AI (e.g., text-to-image models, chatbots, or synthetic data generation), full-stack apps with AI integration, or open-source initiatives that push the limits of creativity and code.

- 📫 How to reach me:  
  Secret hahahahahahha

- 😄 Pronouns:  
  He/Him  

- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  I trained a GAN to generate psychedelic artwork—and now it’s my personal wallpaper factory!
